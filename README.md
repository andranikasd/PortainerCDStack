# PortainerCDStack Documentation üöÄ

Welcome to the **PortainerCDStack** documentation! This guide provides a high-level overview of the repository structure, key components, and features of the stack. It‚Äôs designed to help you understand how the stack works, what components are included, and what future improvements are planned‚Äîall without getting too deep into code examples.

---
- **jenkins**
  Contains everything needed to deploy a Jenkins stack, including a custom Dockerfile, a Compose file, initialization scripts (e.g., for basic security), and a list of plugins.

- **observabillity**
  Contains all components for monitoring:
  - **docker-compose.yml** ‚Äì Defines the overall Observabillity stack.
  - **grafana/** ‚Äì Contains a custom Dockerfile for building a Grafana image with preconfigured dashboards and datasources.
    - **dashboards/** ‚Äì JSON files for pre-built dashboards (e.g., for cAdvisor and Node Exporter).
    - **provisioning/** ‚Äì YAML files that configure Grafana to auto-import dashboards and set up the Prometheus datasource.
  - **prometheus/** ‚Äì Contains a custom Dockerfile and a preconfigured `prometheus.yml` file for scraping metrics.

## Key Components & Their Roles üõ†Ô∏è

### Jenkins Stack
- **Purpose:**
  Automates CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.
- **Highlights:**
  - Preconfigured security settings.
  - Custom plugin management.
  - Ready-to-deploy Docker Compose setup.

### Observabillity Stack
- **Purpose:**
  Provides detailed monitoring of your Docker host and stacks.
- **Components:**
  - **cAdvisor:** Monitors container-level metrics.
  - **Node Exporter:** Collects comprehensive host metrics.
  - **Prometheus (Custom Image):** Scrapes metrics from cAdvisor and Node Exporter.
  - **Grafana (Custom Image):** Displays preconfigured dashboards for visualization.
- **Highlights:**
  - Custom-built images for both Prometheus and Grafana include configuration files within the image, reducing external dependencies.
  - Grafana dashboards are provisioned automatically, making monitoring fast and hassle-free.

## Incoming Features & Enhancements üåü

- **Enhanced cAdvisor Support:**
  Improved compatibility with cgroups v2 for more accurate CPU metrics.

- **Expanded Dashboard Library:**
  Additional Grafana dashboards will be added to cover more aspects of host and container monitoring.

- **Alerting Integration:**
  Planned integration with alerting systems (such as Alertmanager) to enable proactive notifications based on threshold breaches.

- **Auto-Update Improvements:**
  Enhanced auto-update capabilities for both Jenkins and Observabillity stacks to streamline CI/CD workflows.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  Further tightening of security settings and role-based access controls across all services.

## How to Deploy & Use üì¶

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local system or directly deploy it via Portainer.

2. **Configure Your Portainer Stack:**
   If you are using this project alongside with my `HomeLab` proxmox portainer deployed host.
   Create or update your Portainer stack configuration (typically through a `stacks.yaml` file) with entries for each stack. For example:
   ```yaml
   stacks:
     - name: Jenkins
       type: git
       repo: https://github.com/andranikasd/PortainerCDStack.git
       file: ./jenkins/docker-compose.yml
       branch: master
       autoupdate: true
       auth:
         enabled: false

     - name: Observabillity
       type: git
       repo: https://github.com/andranikasd/PortainerCDStack.git
       file: ./observabillity/docker-compose.yml
       branch: master
       autoupdate: false
       auth:
         enabled: false
   ```
3. **Deploy via Portainer:**
   Use Portainer‚Äôs UI or your preferred deployment method to pull the repository and deploy the stacks.

4. **Access Monitoring Dashboards:**
   - **Grafana:** Access via `http://<host-ip>:3000` (default admin credentials: `admin/admin`).
   - **Prometheus:** Access via `http://<host-ip>:9090`.
   - **cAdvisor & Node Exporter:** Available on ports `8080` and `9100` respectively.

## Final Notes & Support ü§ù

The **PortainerCDStack** provides an integrated solution for both CI/CD and observability, making it easier to manage your container environment with minimal configuration. With built-in custom images for Prometheus and Grafana, your monitoring setup is self-contained and robust.

For any issues, improvements, or contributions, please refer to the repository‚Äôs [README.md](./README.md) or contact the maintainer.

*Happy Monitoring & Building! üöÄüìà*
